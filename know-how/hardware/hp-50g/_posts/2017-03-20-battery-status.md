To get an idea about the current status of your batteries, there are a few apps available:

* [BatStatus](http://www.hpcalc.org/details/6400)  
  ![BatStatus]({{ site.url }}/assets/hp-50g-batstat.png)
* [Battery Monitor](http://www.hpcalc.org/details/6587)

To install, unpack the downloaded zip file and transfer the files to the SD card. With the
SD card in the HP 50g, use the integrated file manager to move them to the FLASH folder. Then
reboot the calculator (press <kbd>ON</kbd>+<kbd>F3</kbd> to soft-reset).

You can then access them from the `LIB` (<kbd>â†±</kbd> <kbd>2</kbd>) catalog.
