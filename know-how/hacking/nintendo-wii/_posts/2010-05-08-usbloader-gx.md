Foreign games settings
======================

(for PAL TVs)

* If the game appears all in red, activate the *VidMode: AutoPatch* setting.
* If `Error #02` appears, activate the *Error 02 Fix*
* If you only see a black screen after launching the game, make sure, the Game is not Japanese- or English-only. If so,
  change the *Game language* setting to match that of the game. (Some games don't have a fall-back setting for their
  language, so they will crash if the Wii is set to another language than supported.)
